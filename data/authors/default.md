Exact definitions fall short to all that one is, that is why I prefer to be identified with some ideas; here is a short, non-exhaustive list with some thoughts:

+ "being a Janitor" - in the sense of a type of person who ensures that project and spaces are clean and maintained well
+ "being a Builder" - as someone who can produce value anywhere, in my case mostly with tech
+ "being an Engineer" - an operational framework to solve problems using tools like science and statistics
+ "being a Startup Founder" - in the sense of leading an entity bigger than oneself that can do things that other people need
+ "being a Seeker" - someone who finds pleasure contemplating
+ "being Healthy" - in the sense that I monitor closely some key health markers, with a whoop and regular blood tests
+ "being a Mexican" - a member of the society that created tacos and mariachi, which has its opportunities
...

I have dedicated myself to building tech products and consumer goods since 2014; the products I have built have been used by 1000s of users across different sectors, including industrial (mining and electronics), retail, and health. I have a particular bias toward working on data-intensive projects.
