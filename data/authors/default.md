#### Welcome to my personal website. I'm Everhard Ortega, an engineer and technologist from Mexico, now based in the Bay Area. My mission is to build transformative technologies that shape a better future. Over the years, Iâ€™ve tackled real-world problems across sectors like ERP/Software, Analytics, Foodtech, Retail, Health, and Mining building solutions that have positively impacted millions of users.

* In 2023, I relocated to the Bay Area to take on a new role as a Sales Engineer at Odoo. My objective is to help [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) expand its market share in the $100+ billion ERP industry through strategic innovation and advanced technology solutions.

* From 2020 to 2022, I founded [Magnesia](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/magnesia.mx) and [Chequeo](/blog/chequeo). The former, a platform designed to streamline at-home laboratory testing, enabling patients to order tests in under 5 minutes, addressing the increased demand for at-home health services in Mexico post-Covid-19. The later, a product that helped companies understand the health state of their workforce while complying simultaneously with the nom-035 regulations of the Mexican work law.

* From 2019 to 2022, I played a key role in modernizing data analytics infrastructure for numerous Mexican retail companies through Vincom Analytics. Despite the economic challenges in 2020, the company made significant contributions to the industry.

* From 2017 to 2019, while still an undergrad, a good friend invited me to build the first food-tech start-up in Mexico... so I jumped into the opportunity. I became a founding engineer at [Heartbest Foods](https://www.heartbest.com.mx/) and helped grow the business from zero to + USD 1m in revenue by 2018. As a fun fact, we launched the first vegan cheese in Costco worldwide.

* From 2015 to 2017, I was the Product Manager of the [Conti+ Platform](https://contiplus.net/landing-index), a product developed by Mexican programmers that helps mining companies monitor their conveyor belts --it is used by many customers of ContiTech's C.B.G. in NAFTA.

* Outside of my professional endeavors, I am an avid reader, hacker, golfer, fitness enthusiast, Costco fan, NFT owner, and chef/griller.
