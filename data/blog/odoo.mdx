##Sales Engineer @Odoo

_Author_: Everhard Ortega

Starting of 2023, I decided to move to the Bay Area, where I accepted the challenge of becoming a SE for Odoo with the objective of helping the company gain market from the USD +100 billion ERP industry.

My role is to empower businesses in LATAM with cutting-edge technological solutions. I work closely with clients in the region, leveraging Odoo's robust product suite to unlock their true potential. Whether it's a manufacturing company streamlining their supply chain, a service-based organization optimizing project management, or a retail business enhancing their customer experience, I architect tailored solutions for complex processes across all sectors. 

By deeply understanding the unique challenges faced by each business, I design and implement Odoo's versatile modules, customizing them to align with their specific workflows and requirements. Through seamless integration, automation, and scalability, I enable companies to streamline operations, enhance productivity, and stay agile in the face of evolving market dynamics. By harnessing the full potential of Odoo's advanced tools, I help businesses across LATAM embrace technological advancements and achieve sustainable growth.
