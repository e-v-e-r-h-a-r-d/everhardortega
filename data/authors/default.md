#### Welcome to my personal website. I am Everhard Ortega, an engineer and technologist from Mexico with the conviction of building the best future possible. 

For the last years, I have dedicated myself to solving interesting real-life problems with technology across different sectors: Mining, Foodtech, Retail, and Health. As a result, thousands of users have used the products and solutions that I have built.  

* In 2022, I launched my most recent venture, [Magnesia](https://magnesia.mx), which is a platform that allows patients to order at-home laboratory tests in less than 5 minutes. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the demand for at-home health services has exploded in Mexico, so Magnesia's mission is to fill this space by making the access to health services as simple as a couple of clicks.

* In 2020, I launched [Chequeo](https://chequeo.mx), a product that helps companies understand the health state of their workforce while complying simultaneously with the nom-035 regulations of the Mexican work law. [Learn more](/blog/chequeo)
* In 2019, I helped dozens of Mexican companies in the retail sector to modernize their data analytics infrastructure with an analytics company named Vincom Analytics (R.I.P. in 2020, primarily due to the significant impact that closing the economy had in the apparel retail sector). 
* In 2017, while still an undergrad, a good friend invited me to build the first food-tech start-up in Mexico... so I jumped into the opportunity. I became C.O.O. of the initial team of [Heartbest Foods](https://www.heartbest.com.mx/) and helped grow the business from zero to + USD 1m in revenue by 2018. [Learn more](/blog/heartbest)
* From 2015 to 2017, I was the Product Manager of the [Conti+ Platform](https://contiplus.net/landing-index), a product developed by Mexican programmers that helps mining companies monitor their conveyor belts --it is used by many customers of ContiTech's C.B.G. in NAFTA.

* Among other things, I'm also an avid reader, hacker, golfer, fit-founder, Costco fan, nft owner, and griller.
