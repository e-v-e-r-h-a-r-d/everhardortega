# Elevating Humans with At-Home Healthcare

_Title_: Elevating Humans with at-home healthcare

_Author_: Everhard Ortega

We picked up this idea because of three reasons: 

1) We have personally experienced how stressful it can be for a patient to be stuck in a crowded laboratory, only to spend a few minutes with a phlebotomist. In addition, close relatives have deferred critical medical diagnoses because of a lack of time to visit a laboratory.

2) With the help of legal and clinical advisors, we set up a legal framework that allows us to deliver affordable laboratory testing at the patients' homes. Independent health professionals collect samples and then deliver them to partner laboratories for processing. Partner laboratories have low processing costs, enabling Magnesia to sell the test at a competitive price and achieve healthy margins. 

3) We are not required to own laboratories or any other physical asset to process the lab tests, enabling us to scale our services in any urban city nationwide.

We know that people need Magnesia. Since the COVID Pandemic, the demand for at-home laboratory tests has increased exponentially. Our product allows patients to schedule faster and easier than the traditional methods currently used by laboratories (phone or messages).
