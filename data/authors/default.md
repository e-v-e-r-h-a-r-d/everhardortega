Exact definitions are unfair to all that one is.

That is why I prefer to be identified with some ideas; here is a short, non-exhaustive list:

+ "being a Mexican" - a member of the society that created tacos, which geopolitically has the opportunity to become more productive
+ "being a Janitor" - in the sense of a type of person who ensures that buildings & projects are clean and maintained well
+ "being a Builder" - someone who can produce value anywhere, maybe mostly with tech
+ "being an Engineer" - an operational framework to solve problems using tools like science and statistics
+ "being a Startup Founder" - in the sense of leading an entity bigger than oneself that can do things that other people need
+ "being a Thinker" - someone who finds pleasure contemplating
+ "being Healthy" - in the sense that I monitor closely some key health markers, with a whoop and blood tests
...

I have dedicated myself to building tech products and consumer goods since 2014; the products I have built have been used by 1000s of users across different sectors, including industrial (mining and electronics), retail, and health. I have a particular bias toward working on data-intensive projects.

Got an exciting idea? You can contact me directly at everhard@cenort.com.
