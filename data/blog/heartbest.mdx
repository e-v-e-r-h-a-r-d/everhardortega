# From Zero to One

_Author_: Everhard Ortega

At the beginning of 2016, I was indecisive about what to do post-graduation; I had six months left in the university, and the options available were not convincing enough. At that time, I was working as a Product Manager at Continental (the German industrial corporation), expecting a projection of interesting growth in the corporate world.

Simultaneously, Lalo and I had already started developing companies' websites, and we believed we could begin the path of entrepreneurship by launching a Marketing agency.

In July, we met with Aldo GonzÃ¡lez, CEO of Heartbest, who had been returning from Singapore after his exchange, to philosophize about the next steps that were coming in life; we talked to him about our marketing ideas. He told us that he had several projects with his father, Mr. Aniceto GonzÃ¡lez, and the conversation ended there that day.

The next day in the afternoon, he would call both to invite us to participate in what he called 'the food revolution'; we all got together, and he officially asked us to be part of the team initial of (Heartbest)[https://www.heartbest.com.mx/], without thinking twice I accepted the opportunity. Lalo was made to beg more.

The following two years were full of learning and a lot of work ðŸ˜… 

We launched many products, some successful, others not that much. It took us many months to enter into the biggest supermarkets, but once in, we would execute with much dilligence and creativity.

In the begginning it took us some time to figure out the best role for each one of us, but after some months I would gain enough experience to become in charge of the key operations of the business: demand and purchases planning, delivering on-time to our customers, and ensuring good sell-out performance within our customers.

By Q4 of 2018, we had already crossed the USD 1 million in revenue for that year.

Finally, in January 2019, Lalo and I decided to move on to build a tech company, and a new era in Heartbest began.
